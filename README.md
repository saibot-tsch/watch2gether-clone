<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I made this project because there are no good Watch2Gether / Youtube Video Synchronize Website Clones out there with that many features. Also I wanted to challenge  myself and test my Node.js and Socket.io skills. Worth mentioning I'm not a expert in Web Development, so I would love to get feedback from you.


Why you should use this Watch2Gether Clone:
* Reponsive, SEO friendly and easy to understand UI
* Secure (If you should find any bug please report it)
* Many Features like:
  - Chat
  - Playlist (Add, Remove, Change Playing Video)
  - Role based (Owner, Guest)
  - Owner can kick or ban users
  - Beautiful Video Player
  - Rate Limiting on every page (Socket can only be connected in one room)
